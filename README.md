# **Automatic Torque Compensation Systems for Rough Terrain**

## **Fuzzy Logic-Based Traction Control System**
The **Fuzzy Logic-based Traction Control System** is designed to optimize braking efficiency by dynamically calculating braking torque. Key features include:

- **Braking Torque Calculation**: Based on **longitudinal velocity** and **slip ratio**.
- **Energy Estimation**: Assumes that braking energy is proportional to the product of braking torque and velocity.
- **Energy Profiles**: Generated by adjusting the slip ratio to identify optimal conditions for minimizing energy consumption.

This system leverages fuzzy logic to adapt to varying road conditions, ensuring stability and efficient energy utilization.
